# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction App

A Machine Learning project to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on medical details such as glucose level, BMI, age, etc.  
The app is built using **Python, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit** and deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
We use the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset** from Kaggle.  
It includes 768 records of female patients aged 21+, with the following features:

| Feature | Meaning | Normal Range | High Risk |
|---------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Pregnancies | Number of times pregnant (0 for males) | 0â€“3 | > 6 |
| Glucose | Plasma glucose concentration (mg/dL) | < 110 | > 150 |
| Blood Pressure | Diastolic BP (mmHg) | ~80 | > 90 |
| Skin Thickness | Triceps skin fold (mm) | 10â€“30 | > 40 |
| Insulin | 2-hour serum insulin (ÂµU/mL) | 15â€“276 | > 300 |
| BMI | Body Mass Index | 18.5â€“24.9 | â‰¥ 30 |
| Diabetes Pedigree Function | Genetic diabetes risk | 0.2â€“0.6 | > 1.0 |
| Age | Patientâ€™s age (years) | < 40 | > 50 |
